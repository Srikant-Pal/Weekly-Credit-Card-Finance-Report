Power BI dashboard

 **Objective**: The goal of this project is to understand how customers are using credit cards and find useful patterns from their details and weekly spending.

 **Dataset**: Financial Dataset
 
 1.Customer Dataset: Contains details like customer segment(Silver,Gold,Platinum,Blue),age,gender,martial_status,education level,job_type,customer satisfaction score.

 2. Transaction Dataset: Contains details of credit cards which customer has- like card category,annual fees,Credit limit,Total Revolving Balance,Total Transaction Amount,
    total trans volume,expenditure type,interest earned. This dataset helps analyze customer spending patterns,card usage and financial performance.

**Steps**: Created a new column of Revenue in credit card transaction data,then i have created a bucket list of age and income,so that we can analyze which group of people is giving more revenue,more engaged etc. 

After preparing the data, I created interactive dashboards and Power BI to visualize revenue,customer segments, and transaction patterns.
Used bar and line charts to make trends and to understand it well. Added slicers and filters so that users can explore data by weekly,quartely,card category,age group,income group and more.

**Insights**: As we can see from report overall revenue we have generated is 55M and out of that from interest rate we have earned 8M and so on. Male customers are contributing more in revenue 30M,female 25M. People with higher income mostly use credit card and have better satisfaction score. Bills and Entertainment are the top categories where people spend using credit cards. Blue and Silver credit cards are contributing to 90% of overall transactions. 

This report will help the business to identify WOW change in revenue,customer usage patterns,top-performing categories,and high risk user segments for better decision making.
